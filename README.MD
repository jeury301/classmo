**Key observation:**  Many different organizations have similar needs for their web presence:
- Register customers
- Communicate with customers
- Brand their website

**Our proof-of-concept:** An open-source web app with three core functions:
- Registration - Get customers signed up for sessions
- Discussion - Forums heighten user engagement
- Branding - Customize your own instance

**Containerized:** Deploy an instance anywhere with Docker
